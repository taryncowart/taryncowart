# Hey y'all, I'm Taryn 🥀🖤

I'm the new Creative Director on the Brand Studio team. I joined GitHub after several years in the studio/agency world ([Instrument](https://www.instrument.com), [Rumors](https://rumo.rs)) where I helped with brand marketing for Apple TV, product design, art direction, and product vision for Epic Games, rolling out Twitter's rebrand across their web ecosystem, and lots more. Outside work, I teach Graphic Design at [Portland State University](https://psu.gd). Super stoked to be here.
