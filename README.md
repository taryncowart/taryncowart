# Hey, y'all, I'm Taryn (she/her)! 🥀🖤

I'm the new Creative Director on the Brand Studio team. I joined GitHub after several years in the studio/agency world ([Instrument](https://www.instrument.com), [Rumors](https://rumo.rs)) where I helped with brand marketing for Apple TV, product design, art direction, and product vision for Epic Games, rolling out Twitter's rebrand across their web ecosystem, and lots more. I teach Graphic Design at [Portland State University](https://psu.gd) and love books, politics, music. Super stoked to be here.
